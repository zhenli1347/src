=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

Fixed compilation on platforms (e.g. "Gentoo Prefix") with only a C locale.
[L<GH #22569|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22569>]
Bug first reported downstream at
L<bugs.gentoo.org/939014|https://bugs.gentoo.org/939014>.

=item *

Fixed compilation error on some systems due to a typo in a printf() format.
[L<GH #22793|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22793>]

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this
release.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Starting in Perl 5.39.8, L<POSIX/C<strftime>> would crash or produce odd errors
(such as C<Out of memory in perl:util:safesysmalloc>) when given a format
string that wasn't actually a string, but a number, C<undef>, or an object
(even one with overloaded string conversion).

Now C<strftime> stringifies its first argument, as before.
[L<GH #22498|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22498>]

=item *

Builds with C<-msse> and quadmath on 32-bit x86 systems would crash with a
misaligned access early in the build.
[L<GH #22577|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22577>]

=item *

Using C<goto> to tail call, or using the call_sv() and related APIs to call,
any of trim(), refaddr(), reftype(), ceil(), floor() or stringify() in the
C<builtin::> package would crash or assert due to a C<TARG> handling bug.
[L<GH #22542|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22542>]

=item *

Fixed an issue where C<utf8n_to_uvchr()> failed to correctly identify certain
invalid UTF-8 sequences as invalid.  Specifically, sequences that start with
continuation bytes or unassigned bytes could cause unexpected behaviour or a
panic.  This fix ensures that such invalid sequences are now properly detected
and handled.  This correction also resolves related issues in modules that
handle UTF-8 processing, such as L<Encode>.

=item *

Fixed a double free error or possible memory leak when failing to compile
certain regexps.  [L<GH #21661|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21661>]

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
from version control history.  In particular, it does not include the names of
the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION> for details of how to
report the issue.
